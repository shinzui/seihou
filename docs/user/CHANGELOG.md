### 2026-04-27 (Recover from blocked migrations from the user's side)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-7 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/1-migrations-dx.md` — surfacing the existing
`seihou migrate <module> --bump-only` escape hatch in every
blocked-migration message and adding a new bulk recovery flag for
`seihou run`.

**Behavior change (user-facing):**

- Blocked-migration messages at every site (Migrate, StatusRender,
  PendingMigrations.formatRefusalMessage, Run.applyOneMigration,
  Upgrade.printAdvisory, Upgrade.runOnePostUpgradeMigration) drop the
  "the module author must ship one before this project can move
  forward" finality sentence. Each site now names `seihou migrate
  <name> --bump-only` (the per-module manual escape hatch shipped in
  EP-6) as the recovery path. The PendingMigrations refusal trailer
  composes itself from the actual entry shapes: blocked-only inputs
  get `--bump-only` / `--bump-blocked` wording, runnable-only inputs
  keep the legacy `--with-migrations` wording, mixed inputs get both
  joined.
- `seihou status` Recommended actions tail block lists `seihou
  migrate <name> --bump-only` for blocked modules instead of the
  non-actionable `[blocked]` annotation.
- New flag `seihou run --bump-blocked`: acknowledges every blocked
  module by running `--bump-only` on each (writing the installed
  copy's declared version into the manifest with no migration ops),
  persists the manifest, and proceeds to the rest of the run.
  Compatible with `--with-migrations` for mixed projects: a single
  invocation of `seihou run --bump-blocked --with-migrations` bumps
  blocked entries and applies runnable chains in one pass.
  `--bump-blocked --dry-run` summarizes the bumps without writing.
  Each bump prints `  Bumping <name> <from> -> <to> (no migration
  declared; user-acknowledged).` as the audit trail.

**Why:**

After EP-6 the `--bump-only` escape hatch existed but was not surfaced
anywhere in the in-CLI messaging. Live verification on the
`seihou-project` working tree on 2026-04-27 (after EP-5 partial-applied
both `master-plan` and `exec-plan` to 0.2.0 and the upstream
`agent-seihou` advanced to 0.3.0 without shipping a continuation
migration) showed the user — who is *also* the module author — locked
out. The "wait for the module author to ship one" sentence is wrong
when the user *is* the author, and the absence of `--bump-only` /
`--bump-blocked` in the messaging meant a discoverable recovery
existed only for users who had already read the EP-6 changelog.

**Docs updated:**
- `docs/cli/run.md` — adds `--bump-blocked` to the flags table, adds
  a "Recovering from blocked migrations" subsection, updates the
  refusal-listing example to show the new shape-sensitive trailer,
  and adds `--bump-blocked` invocation examples.
- `docs/cli/migrate.md` — updates the Blocked subsection's example
  text and cross-references `seihou run --bump-blocked` from the
  `--bump-only` use cases.
- `docs/cli/status.md` — updates the Blocked example to show the
  new advisory and replaces the `[blocked]` annotation in the
  Recommended actions example with `seihou migrate <name>
  --bump-only`.
- `docs/cli/upgrade.md` — adds a new "Post-upgrade advisory" section
  documenting the three shapes (full/partial, blocked, benign) and
  what each prints; documents `--with-migrations` (already shipped
  in EP-2 but undocumented here).

### 2026-04-26 (Distinguish benign version bumps from missing migrations)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-6 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/1-migrations-dx.md` — splitting today's
"blocked" outcome into two cases so a module that bumps its declared
`version` without shipping any migrations is no longer treated as
broken.

**Behavior change (user-facing):**
- `seihou status` softens the row for modules whose `migrations`
  field is the empty list and whose manifest version trails the
  installed copy. Previously this rendered as `Blocked: …`; now it
  reads:

  ```
      Pending: 0.2.0 -> 0.3.0 (no migrations declared). Run: seihou upgrade <name> && seihou run
  ```

  The Recommended actions tail lists `seihou upgrade <name> && seihou
  run` (the actual remediation) instead of `[blocked]`. The
  declared-but-unreachable case is unchanged: it still renders as
  `Blocked: …` and `[blocked]` because the author owes a migration.
- `seihou migrate <module>` (no `--to`) for an empty-migrations module
  with a version gap exits zero with a softened note:

  ```
  Note: <name> has no migrations declared (X -> Y). This is a benign
  version bump; run 'seihou upgrade <name> && seihou run' to refresh
  templates and bring the manifest up to date.
  ```

  No manifest change happens at this step; the next `seihou run`
  brings the manifest up to date. With `--to TARGET`, the
  strict-target contract still rejects this case as
  `MigrationGap`. The declared-but-unreachable case is unchanged: it
  still surfaces as `Blocked: …`.
- `seihou run` no longer refuses for the empty-migrations + version
  gap case. The benign entry is reported as a quiet info-level note
  (`Note: <name> has no migrations declared …; will refresh templates
  and bump manifest during this run.`) and the run proceeds normally;
  the manifest's recorded `moduleVersion` is updated to match the
  installed copy by the run flow's existing `updateAllModules`.
  `--with-migrations` treats benign entries as a no-op and continues.
  Declared-but-unreachable entries still trigger the `Blocked: …`
  refusal.
- New flag `seihou migrate <module> --bump-only`: refreshes the
  manifest's recorded `moduleVersion` to match the installed copy's
  declared version without running any migration ops. Mutually
  exclusive with `--to TARGET`. Use case: a project pinned at an
  older version of a module whose unreachable tail (from the
  `Bulletproof partial migration chains` work) the user has manually
  verified to be safe; `--bump-only` updates the bookkeeping without
  staging any chain. Output: `✓ Bumped <name> X → Y (no migration ops).`
- `seihou upgrade --with-migrations`'s post-upgrade advisory softens
  for the benign case: rather than `is blocked: no migration declared
  …`, it reads `<name> has no migrations declared (X -> Y); run
  'seihou run' to refresh templates.`

**Internal:**
- `MigrationPlan` gains a `planMigrationsDeclared :: Bool` field that
  records whether the input migrations list was non-empty. Consumers
  use it to dispatch between `MigrateBlocked` (declared but
  unreachable) and the new `MigrateBenignUpgrade` (no migrations
  declared).
- New `MigrateResult` variant `MigrateBenignUpgrade Version Version`
  for the empty-migrations case. Renderer prints the softened note;
  JSON path emits `{"benign": true, "from": …, "to": …}`.
- New `MigrateError` variant `MigrateConflictingFlags Text` (raised by
  `--bump-only --to`).
- New `MigrateOpts` field `migrateBumpOnly :: Bool`. When set,
  `runMigrate` short-circuits planning: fetches (unless `--no-fetch`),
  evaluates the installed copy's `module.dhall`, and writes the
  declared version into the manifest with an empty
  `ExecutedMigrationPlan`.
- New `Seihou.CLI.PendingMigrations.isBenignUpgrade :: MigrationPlan
  -> Bool`. The run pre-flight uses it to partition pending entries
  into benign (skip the refusal/dispatch entirely) and blocking.
- New `Seihou.CLI.StatusRender.AdviceBenignUpgrade Text Version
  Version` variant for the softened status row.

### 2026-04-26 (Bulletproof partial migration chains)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-5 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/1-migrations-dx.md` — softening the migration
planner's all-or-nothing contract so partial and blocked chains
become first-class outcomes across `seihou status`, `seihou migrate`,
and `seihou run`.

**Behavior change (user-facing):**
- `seihou status` now reports modules whose declared migrations don't
  reach the latest version. Previously these were silent. Three row
  shapes:
  - **Full chain** — `Pending migration: 0.1.0 -> 0.3.0 (N op(s)).
    Run: seihou migrate <name>` (unchanged).
  - **Partial chain** — same chain summary plus a `Note: no migration
    declared from <stuckAt>; remote is at <target>.` line.
  - **Blocked** — `Blocked: no migration declared from
    <manifest-version>; remote is at <target>. The module author must
    ship one before this project can move forward.` The Recommended
    actions tail uses `[blocked] no migration declared for <name>`
    instead of `seihou migrate <name>` because running migrate would
    just print the same blocked message.
- `seihou migrate <module>` (no `--to`) now applies the longest
  reachable prefix when the declared chain doesn't reach the remote
  exactly. The manifest's `moduleVersion` is bumped to the highest
  reached version, and a `Note: no migration declared from
  <stuckAt>; remote is at <target>.` advisory is printed. Blocked
  modules surface the same `Blocked: …` message; the command exits
  zero (no work was done; no manifest change).
- `seihou migrate <module> --to TARGET` keeps its strict-target
  contract: if the declared chain cannot reach `TARGET` exactly
  (partial or blocked), the command errors with `no migration covers
  the gap from X to TARGET`.
- `seihou run` (default) now refuses on every divergence — full,
  partial, and blocked — rather than silently falling back to "no
  pending plan" for partial/blocked. The refusal listing distinguishes
  the three shapes inline.
- `seihou run --with-migrations` applies full and partial chains
  in-band before the run plan is computed. For blocked entries it
  refuses with the same `Blocked: …` message, since there is no
  safe automatic upgrade past a missing migration.
- `seihou upgrade --with-migrations`'s post-upgrade hook now
  surfaces partial and blocked outcomes with the same advisories.

**Internal:**
- `planMigrationChain` now returns `Either MigrationPlanError (Maybe
  MigrationPlan)` where `MigrationPlan` carries a reachable
  `planChain` (possibly empty) and an optional `planUnreachable ::
  Maybe (Version, Version)` tail. The `MigrationGap` error variant
  remains in `MigrationPlanError` for the strict-target path
  (`seihou migrate --to TARGET`) but is no longer produced by the
  planner directly; CLI consumers synthesize it from
  `planUnreachable` when needed.
- `pendingChainFor` widens to `Maybe MigrationPlan`;
  `detectPendingMigrations` widens to `[(ModuleName, MigrationPlan)]`.
  All consumers (`Status`, `Run`, `Upgrade`, `formatRefusalMessage`)
  updated in lockstep.
- New `MigrateResult` variants: `MigrateAppliedPartial`,
  `MigrateDryRunOKPartial`, `MigrateBlocked`. New `ModuleAdvice`
  variants in `StatusRender`: `AdvicePartialMigration`,
  `AdviceBlockedMigration`.

### 2026-04-26 (CLI library-first: enforcement check)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-4 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/2-cli-library-first-convention.md` — adding an
automated enforcement check so the convention cannot silently erode.

**Behavior change (developer-facing only):**
- Added `nix/check-cli-module-placement.sh`, a Bash script that walks
  `executable seihou`'s `other-modules` and fails when an entry does
  not import one of `Options.Applicative`, `Data.FileEmbed`,
  `GitHash`, or `Paths_seihou_cli`, and is not transitively trapped
  via importing another already-trapped seihou module. Two modules
  are exempt with inline justification: `Paths_seihou_cli` (no source
  file on disk) and `Seihou.CLI.AgentLaunchExec` (process launcher
  consumed only by trapped agent-prompt wrappers).
- Wired the script into `flake.nix`'s `checks` attribute as the new
  `cli-module-placement` check, and into the `pre-commit-check.hooks`
  block so a violating commit is rejected at commit time. Both are
  reachable via `nix flake check`.
- Promoted `Seihou.CLI.Completions.{Bash,Fish,Zsh}` from the
  executable target to `seihou-cli-internal`'s `exposed-modules`. The
  three modules generate shell-completion text and have no
  executable-only imports; they are pure helpers and were the only
  pre-EP-4 violations the script flagged.

**Documentation impact:** `CLAUDE.md` gained a one-line pointer to the
new check. No user-facing CLI behaviour changed.

### 2026-04-26 (CLI library-first: AgentLaunch split, Outdated re-exports retired)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-3 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/2-cli-library-first-convention.md` — bringing the
last two known violations of the library-first convention into
compliance through source-level restructuring.

**Behavior change (developer-facing only):**
- `Seihou.CLI.AgentLaunch` is now a library module
  (`seihou-cli-internal`) carrying the pure surface and the
  IO-bearing context-gathering helpers (`AgentContext`,
  `gatherAgentContext`, `agentDirsForSession`, the three
  `*AllowedTools` constants, `substitute`, and the five `format*`
  helpers). The launcher functions (`launchAgent`,
  `launchAgentWith`) moved to a new executable-only module
  `Seihou.CLI.AgentLaunchExec` because they call
  `findExecutable`/`rawSystem`/`exitWith`. Consumers (`Assist`,
  `Bootstrap`, `Setup`) now import from both modules.
- `Seihou.CLI.Outdated`'s export list no longer re-exports
  `OriginInfo`, `OutdatedStatus`, `OutdatedEntry`, `CheckStats`, or
  `compareVersions`. Consumers import these names from their
  canonical homes: `Seihou.CLI.InstallShared` (for `OriginInfo`)
  and `Seihou.CLI.VersionCompare` (for the rest). `Status.hs` and
  `Upgrade.hs` were updated.
- Test suite gains `Seihou.CLI.AgentLaunchSpec` exercising
  `substitute` and the five `format*` helpers — coverage that was
  impossible while these helpers were trapped in the executable
  target.

### 2026-04-26 (CLI cabal restructured; executable depends on library)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-2 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/2-cli-library-first-convention.md` — restructuring
`seihou-cli/seihou-cli.cabal` so the executable depends on the
library and lives in its own source directory.

**Behavior change (developer-facing only):**
- `executable seihou` in `seihou-cli/seihou-cli.cabal` now has
  `build-depends: seihou-cli-internal` and `hs-source-dirs:
  src-exe`. Main.hs and the 27 executable-only modules
  (`Seihou.CLI.AgentLaunch`, `Assist`, `Bootstrap`, `Browse`,
  `Commands`, `Completions`, `Completions.Bash`, `Completions.Fish`,
  `Completions.Zsh`, `Config`, `Context`, `Help`, `Install`, `Kit`,
  `NewModule`, `NewRecipe`, `Outdated`, `Remove`, `Run`,
  `SchemaUpgrade`, `Setup`, `Status`, `Upgrade`, `Validate`, `Vars`,
  `Version`) moved from `seihou-cli/src/` to `seihou-cli/src-exe/`.
  The library still owns `seihou-cli/src/`.
- The executable's `other-modules` list is now strictly the
  trapped-by-dependency set. Each module's trapping reason
  (`Options.Applicative`, `Data.FileEmbed`, `GitHash`,
  `Paths_seihou_cli`, or — transitively — `Seihou.CLI.Commands`) is
  recorded in a "Trapped-modules inventory" table in
  `docs/dev/architecture/overview.md`. The cabal file carries a
  single header comment pointing at the table, since the project's
  `cabal-gild` formatter floats per-line `--` comments to the top of
  `other-modules` and would silently desynchronise per-module
  annotations.
- `Seihou.CLI.SchemaVersion`, `Seihou.CLI.Shared`, and
  `Seihou.CLI.Style` are now exposed by the library
  (previously they were either executable-only or library-private).
- The build no longer compiles shared modules twice. `cabal build`
  now compiles 24 library modules + 28 executable modules per clean
  build, down from 23 + 52.

**Mid-implementation discovery (recorded in EP-2):** the original
plan assumed that removing duplicate `other-modules` entries from
the executable would suffice. Empirically GHC walks
`hs-source-dirs: src` and recompiles every reachable source file
regardless of `other-modules`, preferring local source over the
package. Splitting `hs-source-dirs` was required to make
`build-depends` actually do its job.

**No user-visible CLI behavior change.** The 143-test CLI suite
still passes; `seihou --version` and `seihou --help` still produce
their expected output.

### 2026-04-26 (CLI library-first module-placement convention documented)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-1 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/2-cli-library-first-convention.md` — documenting the
convention that new code under `seihou-cli/src/Seihou/` defaults to
the `seihou-cli-internal` library.

**Behavior change (developer-facing only):**
- Added a "CLI Module Placement Convention" section to
  `docs/dev/architecture/overview.md` (the canonical home of the
  rule) between "Project Structure" and "Technology Stack". It names
  the four executable-only Haskell-package dependencies
  (`Options.Applicative`, `Data.FileEmbed`, `GitHash`,
  `Paths_seihou_cli`), the fifth transitive criterion (importing
  another executable-only seihou module, most commonly
  `Seihou.CLI.Commands`), the cabal-comment format, and the appeal
  procedure for adding an exemption.
- Created a new project-root `CLAUDE.md` carrying a one-paragraph
  summary of the convention plus pointers to the architecture doc and
  the coordinating masterplan.
- Created `docs/dev/contributing.md` as a developer-facing guide that
  mirrors the convention, documents the Conventional Commits
  expectation and the `ExecPlan:` / `MasterPlan:` / `Intention:` git
  trailers, and explains where ExecPlans and MasterPlans live.

**No user-visible CLI behavior change.** Subsequent EPs in
`docs/masterplans/2-cli-library-first-convention.md` (EP-2 cabal
restructure, EP-3 helper extraction, EP-4 enforcement check) encode
the convention in build configuration and tooling.

### 2026-04-26 (`seihou status` surfaces staleness and pending migrations)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-4 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/1-migrations-dx.md` — the rewrite of `seihou status`
to surface outdated modules and pending migrations with copy-pasteable
remediation commands.

**Behavior change:**
- The "Applied modules" block now prints a remediation hint under any
  row that needs action. A row with a pending migration prints
  `Pending migration: X.Y.Z -> A.B.C (N operation(s)). Run: seihou
  migrate <name>`. A row that is merely outdated (no chain declared
  between the manifest's version and the remote) prints `Run: seihou
  upgrade <name>`. When both apply, the migration hint wins because
  `seihou migrate` (after EP-2) is self-contained.
- A new "Recommended actions:" tail block lists the exact commands to
  fix every flagged row. The block is omitted when no row needs
  action.
- The outdated annotation now reads `outdated: X.Y.Z available`
  (matching the masterplan example) instead of the older
  `outdated -> vX.Y.Z`.
- Pending-migration detection now runs on every `seihou status`
  invocation, not only with `--check-updates`. It is purely local
  (manifest + locally installed `module.dhall`), so this adds no
  network IO. `--check-updates` still controls the remote
  outdated-vs-installed check that requires shallow clones.

**Limitations carried over from EP-3:**
- A planner gap (the migrations list does not reach the installed
  version exactly) silences the pending-migration row, the same way it
  silences `seihou run`'s pre-flight. The planner's
  longest-reachable-prefix mode is still future work.
- The "outdated" annotation reflects the locally installed copy versus
  the remote, not the manifest's recorded version versus the remote.
  A user who has refreshed the install (via an earlier `seihou
  upgrade`) without migrating will see "up to date" on the row even
  though their project's manifest is behind. The pending-migration row
  bridges this gap when the planner can form a chain.

**Docs:**
- `docs/cli/status.md` — rewrote the "Update checking" section to
  cover the new remediation hint, the per-row format, and the
  Recommended actions block. Added a new "Pending migrations"
  section.

### 2026-04-26 (`seihou run` is migration-aware)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-3 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/1-migrations-dx.md` — the addition of a pre-flight
pending-migration check to `seihou run` and the new `--with-migrations`
flag.

**Behavior change:**
- `seihou run` now refuses by default when at least one module in the
  current composition has a pending migration chain (the manifest's
  recorded version trails the locally installed copy and the
  intervening migrations resolve to a complete chain). The previous
  behavior — silently writing new template content into paths a
  migration would have moved, orphaning user edits at the old paths
  and skipping the migration's `RunCommand` ops — is no longer
  reachable. The refusal lists the pending range per module and points
  at the next command (`seihou migrate <module>` or
  `seihou run --with-migrations`).
- A new `--with-migrations` flag opts into in-band migration
  application. Each pending chain runs first (via the same code path
  as `seihou migrate <module> --no-fetch`); the run plan's diff is
  computed against the post-migration tree.
- `--dry-run --with-migrations` shows the chain summary plus the run
  plan computed against the *current* (pre-migration) disk, with a
  one-line note. Computing a real post-migration dry-run would
  require staging file moves to disk, which `--dry-run` declines to
  do.
- Detection is scoped to the composition: a pending chain on an
  applied module that is not part of the current run does not block.
- Detection is best-effort: planner gaps (the migrations list does
  not reach the installed version exactly) silently fall back to "no
  pending chain", so the new pre-flight is a no-op in that case and
  the older behavior is preserved.

**Docs:**
- `docs/cli/run.md` — added a "Migration awareness" subsection, the
  `--with-migrations` row in the options table, and two new examples.
- `docs/user/migrations.md` — added an "Integration with `seihou
  run`" subsection alongside the existing `upgrade` and `status`
  integrations.

### 2026-04-26 (`seihou migrate` is self-contained)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-2 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/1-migrations-dx.md` — the
`runMigrate`-fetches-the-remote refactor and the new `--no-fetch` flag.

**Behavior change:**
- `seihou migrate <module>` no longer requires `seihou upgrade` to be
  run first. By default it now reads the source URL from
  `~/.config/seihou/installed/<name>/.seihou-origin.json`, clones the
  source repository shallowly, plans the chain against the remote's
  `module.dhall`, applies it, and refreshes the on-disk installed copy
  on success. The chatty progress lines (`Fetching …`) are suppressed
  with `--json`.
- A new `--no-fetch` flag preserves the legacy behavior for offline /
  hermetic workflows: in that mode `seihou migrate` performs no
  network IO and consults only the locally installed copy.
- Soft failures in the fetch path (no `.seihou-origin.json`, clone
  failure, module not present in the remote) emit a one-line note and
  silently fall back to the local-only path. JSON mode stays silent.
- `seihou upgrade --with-migrations` invokes the migration with
  `--no-fetch` internally, since the upgrade step has already
  refreshed the installed copy.

**Docs:**
- `docs/cli/migrate.md` — added a "Default behavior: fetch first"
  section, documented `--no-fetch`, and reframed the examples around
  the new default.
- `docs/user/migrations.md` — added a "Self-contained `seihou
  migrate`" subsection and updated the `seihou upgrade` integration
  note to reflect the internal `--no-fetch` reuse.

### 2026-04-26 (`outdated`/`upgrade` read true module.dhall version)

**Reviewed commits:** EP-1 of MasterPlan
`docs/masterplans/1-migrations-dx.md` — the introduction of
`Seihou.CLI.RemoteVersion.fetchTrueModuleVersion` and the rewrite of
`outdated`/`upgrade` to call it.

**Bug fix:**
- `seihou outdated` and `seihou upgrade` now report a module as outdated as
  soon as the upstream `module.dhall` declares a higher `version`, even when
  the upstream `seihou-registry.dhall` has not been re-synced. Previously, a
  registry that listed a stale `version = Some "0.1.0"` would mask a
  `modules/<name>/module.dhall` that already declared `0.3.0`, and both
  commands reported "up to date". The comparison now reads the truthful
  version from the cloned `module.dhall` and ignores the registry's static
  metadata.

**Docs:**
- `docs/cli/outdated.md` and `docs/cli/upgrade.md` each gained a section
  explaining how the "available" version is determined and why the registry
  index is intentionally bypassed.

### 2026-04-19 (parameterized dependency multi-instantiation)

**Reviewed commits:** the eight-commit ExecPlan 10 series culminating in
the multi-instance diamond fixtures.

**Features documented:**
- **Multi-instantiation of parameterized dependencies** — Two dependency edges pointing at the same child module with different `vars` now produce two independent invocations of that child. Two edges with identical `vars` dedupe to a single invocation. Before this change the second invocation was silently dropped; the real-world symptom was that `master-plan` compositions produced only one `.claude/skills/` symlink instead of two.
- **Manifest schema v2** — `.seihou/manifest.json` is now version 2. Each `AppliedModule` entry gains an optional `parentVars` field recording the parent-supplied bindings that produced the invocation. Version-1 manifests load unchanged (missing `parentVars` decodes to an empty map).
- **`seihou status` disambiguation** — When two invocations of the same module appear, the status line appends the bindings inline (`claude-skill-link [skill.name=exec-plan]`) so the two are distinguishable.

**Updates:**
- `docs/user/module-authoring.md` — added a "Multi-instantiation" subsection under "Composition and dependencies" with a worked `claude-skill-link` example showing two invocations producing two symlinks, and an explanation that identity is the edge's `vars`, not any downstream override. No new authoring syntax is required.

### 2026-04-19 (consolidated template reference; design-doc fixes)

**Reviewed commits:** this entry tracks the consolidation and cleanup
pass that follows the standalone-block trim work below.

- Added `docs/user/templating.md` — a single authoritative user-facing Template reference covering placeholder substitution (syntax, coercion rules, escape), conditional blocks (syntax, full expression grammar, nesting, untaken-branch semantics), standalone-block whitespace trim (qualification rules, what is absorbed, blank-line preservation, indentation/tabs), the five-variant error taxonomy with line-number semantics, authoring patterns (optional line, feature gate, if/else-with-default, multi-feature matrix, version-gated content), and guidance on when to escalate to DhallText or Structured.
- Trimmed `docs/user/module-authoring.md §Strategy: template` to a brief summary with a pointer to `templating.md`, removing the duplicated placeholder-syntax and conditional-blocks detail that had grown in place.
- Updated `docs/user/getting-started.md` — the Step 3 "Going further" teaser now links to `templating.md` rather than back into `module-authoring.md`.
- Fixed `docs/dev/design/proposed/generation-strategies.md §Placeholder Engine` — replaced three fictional signatures (`substitutePlaceholders`, `parseTemplate`, and the `Segment` ADT) with the actual public entry points in `Seihou.Engine.Template` (`renderTemplate`, `renderTemplateText`, `renderDestPath`, `renderCommand`, `valueToText`, `expandConditionals`). Corrected a typo in the coercion rule (`VTText` → `VText`). Added a note pointing to `docs/user/templating.md` for the authoring-level reference.

**No documentation needed:**
- Preserved the earlier 2026-04-19 standalone-trim entry as-is; this pass is a consolidation on top of it, not a replacement.

### 2026-04-19 (standalone-block whitespace trim)

**Reviewed commits:** the standalone-block addition (following the
2026-04-19 doc-sync entry below).

- Updated `docs/user/module-authoring.md` — expanded the "Conditional blocks" paragraph with a "Standalone block lines" section explaining when a tag is absorbed (only non-whitespace on its line → surrounding indent + one trailing newline consumed), and rewrote the worked example in the new readable multi-line style.
- Updated `docs/dev/design/proposed/generation-strategies.md` — added a "Standalone-block whitespace trim" bullet to the Conditional blocks semantics list, citing Mustache/Handlebars as the reference for the behavior.
- Updated `docs/plans/9-inline-conditionals-in-template-strategy.md` — Revisions entry and a Decision Log entry recording the choice to add standalone trim rather than adopt an external templating engine (Ginger/Mustache/etc.).

**Features documented:**
- **Standalone-block whitespace trim** — When a `{{#if}}`, `{{#else}}`, or `{{/if}}` tag is the only non-whitespace on its line, the tag absorbs the surrounding indent and the single trailing newline, so multi-line readable templates no longer emit blank-line cruft. Exactly one newline is consumed per trim side, preserving deliberate blank-line spacing inside blocks.

### 2026-04-19 (doc sync: --confirm-defaults, Dhall-as-templating evaluation, ExecPlan 9 M5)

**Reviewed commits:** `0d79a1c` through `154b330`. Supplements the
2026-04-16 and 2026-04-18 entries which advanced CHANGELOG content but
did not advance the "Last Reviewed Commit" pointer.

- Updated `docs/cli/run.md` — added `--confirm-defaults` to the Options table and a "Reviewing defaults interactively" subsection, plus an example. This closes the doc gap from ExecPlan 7 (2026-04-18 work landed the flag and user-guide text but not the CLI reference).
- Updated `docs/user/getting-started.md` — filled the `seihou run` flags table with `--save-prompted`, `--no-save-prompted`, `--commit`, `--commit-message`, and `-c, --context` (pre-existing omissions). Added a "Going further: conditional blocks inside a template" teaser to Step 3 with a short `{{#if IsSet license}}` example and a pointer to the `Strategy: template` section of `module-authoring.md`, so a first-time reader discovers the block form without having to read the reference.
- Updated `docs/dev/design/proposed/cli-commands.md` — added `runConfirmDefaults :: Bool` to the `RunOpts` record, the flag to the usage line, and a row to the options table.
- Updated `docs/dev/design/proposed/variable-resolution.md` — added a "Reviewing default and parent values" subsection under "Interactive Prompts" describing the `confirmDefaults` pass, its `FromDefault`/`FromParent` source filter, the `FromPrompt` retagging, and the conditions under which the flag is a no-op.
- Updated `docs/dev/architecture/overview.md` — revised the "Templates Stay Dumb" decision to reflect inline `{{#if}}` conditional blocks; updated the project-tree comment for `Template.hs`. Template bodies now support boolean gating via `{{#if}}/{{#else}}/{{/if}}`; anything richer still requires `DhallText`.
- ExecPlan 9 M5 (sibling `nix-haskell-flake` migration, `seihou-modules` commit `b6ccd2a`) and the follow-up test-coverage broadening (`154b330`) are covered by this entry; no in-repo user docs changed for those.
- ExecPlan 8 (Dhall-as-templating evaluation: `492c5ac` through `af1c372`) landed a design-only doc at `docs/dev/design/proposed/dhall-as-templating-evaluation.md` plus test-only prototypes (`Seihou.Engine.TypedDhallText`, the now-retired `TemplatePrototype`, and the `split-flake` / `dhall-text-flake` / `typed-dhall-text-flake` / `conditional-template-flake` fixtures). No user docs needed.

**Features documented:**
- **`seihou run --confirm-defaults`** — Interactive flag that pauses between variable resolution and plan compilation, re-prompting every variable whose value came from a module default (priority 8) or a parent-binding export (priority 7). Overrides flow through `FromPrompt` retagging into the existing save-prompted offer. No-op in non-interactive mode and when nothing is default- or parent-sourced.

**No documentation needed:**
- `492c5ac` Reproduce split-flake pain point in-tree (fixture-only)
- `e02cafc` Prototype A (dhall-text single-source flake; fixture + evaluation prototype)
- `cd8f8b1` Prototype B (typed-function dhall-text renderer; experimental module, test-only)
- `c4f9cdd` Prototype C (inline `{{#if}}` prototype; superseded and deleted in ExecPlan 9 M3)
- `59623d9` / `af1c372` Evaluation doc (dev-only design record)
- `154b330` Broaden `renderTemplateText` test coverage (test-only)
- `5ddfab7` Record ExecPlan 9 outcomes and sibling-repo migration (plan doc + cross-repo commit)
- `ab29a2a` / `9faa2c2` / `69e7de4` ExecPlan 7 source + test + initial doc commits — superseded here by the `docs/cli/run.md` and `docs/dev/design/proposed/` updates above

### 2026-04-18 (inline conditional blocks in template strategy)

**Reviewed commits:** ExecPlan 9 milestones M1–M4

- Updated `docs/user/module-authoring.md` — added a "Conditional blocks" subsection under "Strategy: template" documenting `{{#if}}`, `{{#else}}`, and `{{/if}}` syntax, the shared `when`-expression grammar, unbounded nesting, an optional-postgres worked example, and the restriction that blocks apply to bodies only (not dest paths or shell commands).
- Updated `docs/dev/design/proposed/generation-strategies.md` — added "Conditional blocks (Template only)" under "Strategy Dispatch" with the same syntax, semantics, and a pointer to `docs/plans/9-inline-conditionals-in-template-strategy.md`. Synced the `PlaceholderError` sketch with the three new block-level variants.

**Features documented:**
- **Inline `{{#if}}` conditional blocks in the Template strategy** — A single `.tpl` can branch on resolved variables instead of shipping two near-duplicate templates gated by mutually exclusive `when` conditions. Supports `{{#if}}…{{/if}}`, `{{#if}}…{{#else}}…{{/if}}`, arbitrary nesting, and the same expression grammar as step-level `when`. Template bodies only — `renderDestPath` and `renderCommand` remain placeholder-only.

- New module: `Seihou.CLI.SavePrompted` — pure logic for collecting and persisting prompted values

**Features documented:**
- After running a module interactively, Seihou offers to save prompted variable values to `.seihou/config.dhall` so they are reused on subsequent runs without re-prompting. Values are shown for confirmation before saving. Existing config values are not silently overwritten.
